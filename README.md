Hello! My name is Aliyah and I am currently learning Python (for data analytics) via the glorious internet!

Overall, I'm interested in learning the following languages:
- ✨ Python 
- ✨ JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
- ✨ Java

Right now, I'm using GitHub to learn from others and keep track of progress over time. 
This will eventually change, but as a beginner I'm not yet sure on ways to make helpful contributions.
Thanks for reading!
